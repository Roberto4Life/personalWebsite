        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Graduating High School I went straight to community college for one
          year to do my generals. Although I wanted to continue my educaction,
          family medical emergencies put me in debt and I had to find a job to
          stop my family from losing our home. Going into Len Bucsh Roses I started from
          an entry level worker and worked my way to a Team Lead Position with a
          Supervisor position available for me to move up to. However an 
          opportinity came up so that I can continue my educaction an work at the
          same time and I moved to a part time position to train my replacement.
